# Building-Footprint-Detection-from-Satellite-Images-using-Unet
Deep learning pipeline for detecting and segmenting building footprints from satellite imagery using a custom U-Net model. Includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, visualization, and GeoJSON vectorization of outputs.

🧩 Problem Statement
Accurately identifying building footprints from satellite imagery is a critical task in domains such as urban planning, disaster management, and geospatial analytics. Manual annotation of such features is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and not scalable across large geographical regions.

This project aims to build an automated pipeline for semantic segmentation of satellite images using a deep learning model (U-Net). The objective is to classify each pixel in a satellite image as either:

Building

Background

✨ Key Goals:
Preprocess raw satellite imagery and corresponding ground truth masks.

Train a U-Net model to detect building footprints.

Evaluate the model using metrics like IoU, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.

Visualize results, including masks, boundaries, and overlays.

Export predictions as raster (.tif) and vector (.geojson) formats for downstream GIS applications.

This solution demonstrates the potential of deep learning to automate building detection with high precision, enabling scalable and reproducible mapping for urban analytics.

🚀 Applications
This project has multiple real-world applications, including:

🏗 Urban Planning & Smart Cities
Helps planners understand city growth, infrastructure needs, and zoning using up-to-date building maps.

🛰 Disaster Response & Damage Assessment
Allows emergency services to identify collapsed or damaged buildings post-disaster using pre- and post-event imagery.

🌍 Geospatial Mapping & GIS Integration
Facilitates automatic digitization of building layers for use in mapping software like QGIS or ArcGIS.

📡 Remote Sensing & Earth Observation
Enhances satellite data interpretation by extracting meaningful features like man-made structures.

🧠 Research in Deep Learning & Computer Vision
Serves as a valuable case study for semantic segmentation using U-Net and related architectures.

🛤 Infrastructure Monitoring
Tracks the development of new constructions and urban sprawl over time.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Accurately identifying building footprints from satellite imagery is a critical task in domains such as urban planning, disaster management, and geospatial analytics. Manual annotation of such features is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and not scalable across large geographical regions.

This project aims to build an automated pipeline for semantic segmentation of satellite images using a deep learning model (U-Net). The objective is to classify each pixel in a satellite image as either:

- **Building**
- **Background**

### 🔑 Key Goals
- Preprocess raw satellite imagery and corresponding ground truth masks.  
- Train a U-Net model to detect building footprints.  
- Evaluate the model using metrics like **IoU**, **Accuracy**, **Precision**, and **Recall**.  
- Visualize results, including masks, boundaries, and overlays.  
- Export predictions as raster (`.tif`) and vector (`.geojson`) formats for downstream GIS applications.

This solution demonstrates the potential of deep learning to automate building detection with high precision, enabling scalable and reproducible mapping for urban analytics.
